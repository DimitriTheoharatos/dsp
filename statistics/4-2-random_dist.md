[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

### Solution

The following solution implies that the user has the following packages: numpy (np), pandas (pd), thinkstats2, and thinkplot. 

This question investigates whether the random function generated by numpy is truly a random sequence. This means that every single value in the range [0,1) has the same chance of occurring. 

We start by storing the results of a random number generator that generates 1000 random samples.  This is done with the Numpy.random.random function. 

```python
rand_nums = np.random.random(1000)
``` 

Once we do this, we plot the PMF of this distribution, which we expect to be uniform. The code and plot are replicated below:



```python
pmf_rand = thinkstats2.Pmf(rand_nums)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf_rand, linewidth = 0.05)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel = 'Random Number', ylabel = 'PMF')
```

As expected, the PMF shows a uniform distribution with the expected probability of 0.001 across all distributions.  This makes intuitive sense, since we if multiply 0.001 by our range 1000, we get 1, the probability of the entire sample space. 

We can verify that the random number generator is truly random by investigating the CDF as well.  We would expect this to be a linearly increasing function from 0 to 1. 

```python
cdf_rand = thinkstats2.Cdf(rand_nums)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf_rand)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel = 'Random Number', ylabel = 'CDF')
```

Thus, the numpy.random.random function generator produces a truly random sequence.
